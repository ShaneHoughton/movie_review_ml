    "Frame the Problem and Look at the Big Picture\n",
    "=====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the objective in business terms:** We have been hired by Magic Films for their new streaming service which provides access to a wide variety of movies. \n",
    "2. **How will your solution be used?** They want to eventually know what movies should be displayed and promoted on the homepage to attract users based on written reviews from viewers as well as what movies to remove from the website to save money on licensing fees.\n",
    "3. **What solutions are in place?** For certain businesses such as the restaurant business, they try and identify certain keywords in reviews to find out what they are doing well and their customers like and what they can improve on.\n",
    "4. **How should you frame this problem?** This is a supervised binary classification problem. Based on words and how they are used in a review we want to determine whether the review was `Positive` or `Negative`.\n",
    "5. **How should performance be measured? Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?** Because we are not to identify as many positives as we can by risking false positives and we are not trying to identify all the negatives we can, we believe we should use F1 score to find a middle ground. We want to reduce false positives and false negatives as equally as possible.\n",
    "6. **What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?** We would like to get our score as close to 1.0 as possible. A goal is to get at least .85 or better.\n",
    "7. **What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?** We have had multi-classification experience with the MNIST data set for trying to decide what a number a written digit or what article of clothing something is. More importantly, we previously created a binary-classification model that would try to predict whether there would be an early spring or not. We would not be able to directly reuse this model in particular because we are trying to identify words within a review to determine if the review was positive or not.\n",
    "8. **Is human expertise available?** We do not have anyone readily available but we are advised on the Readme to contact Andrew Maas, the organizer of the dataset, with any questions. We can also try and contact the user who uploaded the dataset to Kaggle.\n",
    "9. **How would you solve the problem manually?** The manual approach would to be to parse up the reviews and try and filter out words with negative or positive connotations in order to decide whether a review is positive or negative. This could be a problem with sarcastic reviews and reviews with spelling errors or slang.\n",
    "10. **List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far. Verify assumptions if possible.** We are assuming that the data set is all primarily english and has no spelling mistakes or errors in the reviews."

       "\"This short film that inspired the soon-to-be full length feature - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers. The short film stars Edward the Spatula who after being fired from his job, joins in the fight against the evil spoons. This premise allows for some funny content near the beginning, but is barely present for the remainder of the feature. This film's 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately not much else lies below it. The plot that is set up doesn't really have time to show. But it's surely follows it plot better than many high-budget Hollywood films. This film is worth watching at least a few times. Take it for what it is, and don't expect a deep story.\""

But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS, which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern.'"
